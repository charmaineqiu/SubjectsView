Two Beds in Motel Natchitoches,"JACK says I'm behaving like Deirdre. We are facing each other on opposite beds in a motel room in Louisiana. It is after 3 a.m. and all he's wearing are white briefs with upbeat multicolored stripes. This is no Calvin Klein advertisement. This is a baggy pair of cheap underwear on a 34-year-old with a belly. Ten days ago, I would have called him the love of my life.    Deirdre is not someone I wish to be compared to. For Jack and me she has come to represent the intersection of hopelessness and obsession. Quite simply, she would like our friend Nick to marry her, even though their four-year relationship technically ended more than a year ago. She recently bought a house around the corner from his and, as ''friends,'' they continue to eat, shop and exercise together. When the four of us went to see ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' I noticed his hand on her knee, their fingers entwined.   ",joy,5,0.3208049165683891,2004-12-19

But let's get one thing straight: I didn't say the words. I didn't need to ask. She didn't need to answer. It never mattered.   ",fear,5,0.05132302810349831,2004-12-26

At first I was nervous around her; she was a serious Christian to my skittish heathen, with a mother who expressed hopes that she find ''a nice Christian boy.''
